## Research

In the research we performed for the purposes of implementing the project, we found predefined lists that define healthy choices from vetted sources that have been sourced by renowned scientists such as Eating Tips: A Nutrition Guide for People Living with HIV/AIDS by the Godâ€™s Love We Deliver nonprofit. We also conducted research into existing guidelines for managing HIV, such as those provided by the World Health Organization or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in order to develop these lists. We also conducted technical research on web application development using frameworks such as Node and Firebase to help create our application and deploy it.
