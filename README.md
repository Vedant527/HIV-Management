# HIV-Management

This project is for CS6440 at Georgia Tech. The primary goal is to create an HIV-Management portal that allows users to log medications, appointments, meals, and workouts. To access the firebase db, retrieve a secret key from the firebase authentication page and store it in a file named pass.json in the root directory of this project.
